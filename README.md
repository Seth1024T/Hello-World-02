Hello world 02: When is a derived work so different that it's has it's own copyright
This program builds on and modifies a program called hello world (link: https://github.com/Seth1024T/Hello-World).

There are two parts to a program:
<ul>
<li>1) what is displayed to the user</li>
<li>2) the program itself and the language it's written in (Ruby in this case)</li>
</ul>

If a derived work is sufficiently different from the original work, it might be considered a seperate work in terms of copyright, but how far must one go to get this result?

To make a derived work that is considered seperate, and has it's own copyright: both the display to the user, and the computer code needs to be significantly modified. For a small program like hello world, that should be easy, but for very large programs it's very likely that there will be non-modified code (such as part of, or complete libraries that often contain functions, and classes for example). Never the less, how you choose to combine those classes and functions, will dertermine how the software works and the actual display to the user. The computer language also has underlying code, but once you buy or use a language that is free, you can use it as a tool to produce work that may have copyright applied to it. The same could apply to functions and classes that form a higher level of language for you to use as tools to create things.

Some langauges, and software libraries will use the create stuff as a selling point. Hello World for example focuses on what it does and does not realize that it contains the start to a library of functions that can be used as tools to make many more things, and this is the nature of both small programs and larger programs.

The law has not kept up with this new technology, and our economic system also has a number of problems with it also. Certainly, making it clear from the start that you can use and modify software without cost is a great (legal tool) for those who like to create things. To make things for profit, there will be a need to understand legal issues of copyright in more detail and when a derived work needs it's own copyright.
