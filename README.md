# Hello-World-02

The following material is a guide only. The forces of econmics sometimes make things more complicated (the way software is designed, produces and sold may not make sense to you at all times--for a very good reason, you might be right). Also, you should seek legal help, especially if you intend to make software for profit. GNU GPL and some for cost software (including computer languages) will allow you to create new things, that in most cases will belong to you. Some computer languages do use third party libraries for example, and you may need to find out what happens if you incude those third party libraries in your code. If you work for a company or study at a school, they may also argue that they own what you create--and yes that's wrong, but not leagally wrong it seems.

GNU GPL also has the added benifit (and perhaps the major benifit to many) that you can fix, or modify programs in a minor way so that it's still got the owner's copyright, and you must also use a similar GNU GPL licence (from what the author understands to be the case). Commerical applications, and software don't often allow you to look under the hood, and customize, modify, or fix things--and part of the way they prevent that is by restricting your access, and by keeping things a secret.

With a GNU GPL the owner can merge your modifications or fixes if they wish to--taking some of the blame if you get things wrong, but still giving you some credit for the good changes. On the other hand if the owner does not merge your work, it may continue on it's own branch, and you may end up with a reputation based on how good or useful those changes were.

If you are not a user of github, then your modified program would still need to carry the orginal GNU GPL license, and that means crediting the copyright owner by default. while you will still get credit for you modifications:

<blockquote cite="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.en.html#IWantCredit">
You can certainly get credit for the work. Part of releasing a program under the GPL is writing a copyright notice in your own name (assuming you are the copyright holder). The GPL requires all copies to carry an appropriate copyright notice.

However GNU GPL also state that your modifications in "most cases" will have copyright, meaning you will have to ask the owner to merge your changes to thier project (which they can do so under a GPL GNU licence anyway), because if you are not on github, they may not know of your modifications. However some copyright owners don't maintain their projects and that may meant your modified version might become the new updated version that people will may use to do futher updates and changes under the GNU GPL licence.

One thing to note about Github: is that it can be a community that is private, or public. The resultant software and how it is used is defined by the group that produces it (including licenses).

<blockquote cite="https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/#what">
GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

Hello world 02: Attempt to make a derived work that is so different from hello world (https://github.com/Seth1024T/Hello-World), that it can have its own copyright added to it (and any applicable licenses if desired).

Hello world 02 Project: Make a program that says hello to a user that logs in using a password, or creates a password that is linked to thier nick-name/user-name (or real-name if they so desire). A local file can store the infomation about the user or users.

By creating a significantly different program from hello world, we might consider this program a seperate program for the puposes of copyright. However we will take a look at Hello World to see if we can use or modify some of the stuff it has, and think about how its concepts might be redefined for the purposes of our own project (the community that takes a interest in this type of program). This is good practice, since even if you create all or most of your own code, you will forget what you did, and will have to go back and study your own code, and you may find you had some good ideas there that could be repurposed for your new project. You may also find some other projects may be useful in giving you some ideas for you new project.

The distinction of a new program versus a slight modification of a existing program is somthing you have to keep in mind.

Finally GNU GPL may give you some confidence to use free libraries of code (functions, classes, data structures, maps, pictures, videos and so on: some stuff might be better licensed under creative commons however).

Some langauges, resources, and libraries are specifically sold so you can use them to create new programs--so that pathway to creating stuff also exists, and you can always license your new creations under GNU GPL in such cases: since you should have copyright of anything original you create (unless your company or school you study in wants to claim it).

When is a derived work so different that it has its own copyright
This program builds on and modifies a program called hello world (link: https://github.com/Seth1024T/Hello-World).

There are two parts to a program:
<ul>
<li>1) what is displayed to the user</li>
<li>2) the program itself and the language it's written in (Ruby in this case)</li>
</ul>

If a derived work is sufficiently different from the original work, it might be considered a seperate work in terms of copyright, but how far must one go to get this result?

To make a derived work that is considered seperate, and has its own copyright: both the display to the user, and the computer code needs to be significantly modified. For a small program like hello world, that should be easy, but for very large programs it's very likely that there will be non-modified code (such as part of, or complete libraries that often contain functions, and classes for example). Never the less, how you choose to combine those classes and functions, will dertermine how the software works and the actual display to the user. The computer language also has underlying code, but once you buy or use a language that is free, you can use it as a tool to produce work that may have copyright applied to it. The same could apply to functions and classes that form a higher level of language for you to use as tools to create things.

Some langauges, and software libraries will use the create stuff as a selling point. Hello World for example focuses on what it does and does not realize that it contains the start to a library of functions that can be used as tools to make many more things, and this is the nature of both small programs and larger programs.

The law has not kept up with this new technology, and our economic system also has a number of problems with it also. Certainly, making it clear from the start that you can use and modify software without cost is a great (legal tool) for those who like to create things. To make things for profit, there will be a need to be a understand legal issues of copyright in more detail, and when a derived work needs its own copyright.

If your modifictaion to hello world or any other program is only minor, or you want to fix some bugs you find, or possibly improve the program in some minor way, then this may apply to you:

<blockquote cite="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.en.html#GPLCommercially">
    If I use a piece of software that has been obtained under the GNU GPL, am I allowed to modify the original code into a new program, then distribute and sell that new program commercially? (#GPLCommercially)

    You are allowed to sell copies of the modified program commercially, but only under the terms of the GNU GPL. Thus, for instance, you must make the source code available to the users of the program as described in the GPL, and they must be allowed to redistribute and modify it as described in the GPL.

    These requirements are the condition for including the GPL-covered code you received in a program of your own.
