Hello world 02: When is a derived work so different that it's has it's own copyright
This program builds on and modifies a program called hello world (link: https://github.com/Seth1024T/Hello-World).

There are two parts to a program:
1) what is displayed to the user
2) the program itself and the language it's written in (Ruby in this case)

If a derived work is sufficiently different from the original work, it might be considered a seperate work in terms of copyright, but how far must one go to get this result?
